<h1><%= @guest.name %></h1>
<h1><%= @guest.occupation %></h1>





<p>Choose a guest using this link <%= link_to "Guest List", guests_path(@guests) %></p>
<p>Choose an episode using this link <%= link_to "Episode List", episodes_path(@episodes) %></p>
<p>(Unfortunately our dropdown menu is out of commission due to lack of time 🙁)</p>
<p> I have a good idea on how to show the useres the guests for an episode but I ran out of time and I couldn't debug it 😢</p>
